                    Monkey 47 delivers an extraordinary complexity with a distinctly woody, earthy profile
                    balanced by bright citrus and floral notes. The initial taste overwhelms with spice, moving
                    to citrus in the middle, and finishing with earthy sweetness. Its nose offers an intricate
                    blend of lavender, chamomile, lemon verbena, cardamom, and mint, with deeper layers
                    of ginger and lemongrass.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Crafted at the Black Forest Distillery by master distiller Christoph Keller, Monkey 47 is made
                    using a traditional method with a molasses-based spirit. The 47 botanicals, many foraged
                    from the Black Forest, are macerated in the base spirit before being distilled in small
                    batches through traditional copper pot stills. The gin is then matured in earthenware
                    containers for three months before being brought to bottle strength with local spring
                    water.

                    Hendrick's is renowned for its distinctively floral aroma with a clean, crisp taste that
                    balances traditional gin notes with unique infusions. The flavor is smooth with a light
                    sweetness, featuring prominent cucumber and rose petal notes that create a refreshing,
                    delicate character. The finish is medium-length, featuring lingering floral notes and a

                <p class="mb-6">
                    What sets Hendrick's apart is its unique distillation method, employing two distinct stills:
                    the Bennett still (which produces a more oily, full-bodied spirit) and the Carter-Head still
                    (which yields a lighter, more floral spirit). After distillation, the gin is infused with Bulgarian
                    rose petals and cucumber to create its signature flavor. This marriage of different
                    distillation methods and post-distillation infusions creates Hendrick's distinctive
                    character, overseen by Master Distiller Lesley Gracie.

                    Produced at the Bruichladdich Distillery on the Scottish island of Islay, The Botanist combines nine traditional gin botanicals with 22 hand-foraged local herbs and flowers. These botanicals are harvested by the distillery's professional forager from the hills, shores, and bogs of the island. The slow, artisanal distillation takes place in a unique Lomond still nicknamed "Ugly Betty," allowing for a gentle extraction of the delicate flavors and essential oils from the botanicals.

                    Tanqueray's production process has remained largely unchanged since Charles Tanqueray first perfected his recipe in 1830. The gin is distilled four times in traditional copper pot stills, including the famous "Old Tom" still that survived the London Blitz of WWII. The botanicals are steeped directly in the neutral spirit before distillation, allowing for a thorough extraction of flavors. This time-honored process ensures consistency in Tanqueray's distinctive character, which has been recognized as the world's best gin in numerous competitions.

                    Aviation Gin is batch-distilled using a unique maceration process that creates its smooth, full-bodied flavor. The botanicals are steeped in grain spirit for 48 hours before distillation in a custom-built pot still. Unlike traditional London Dry gins, Aviation focuses on a balanced blend of botanicals rather than leading with juniper, creating what's known as an "American Dry Gin." This innovative approach has helped define the New Western style of gin that showcases a broader range of botanical flavors.

                    Distilled in copper pot stills in small batches by Victoria Distillers, Empress 1908 Gin combines traditional distillation methods with unique botanicals. The signature ingredient, butterfly pea blossom, is added after distillation to impart the gin's natural indigo color. This botanical not only gives the gin its distinctive hue but also creates a magical color-changing effect when mixed with citrus or tonic water, turning from deep blue to soft pink. The recipe was inspired by the tea served at the iconic Fairmont Empress Hotel in Victoria, British Columbia.

                    Roku Gin is crafted by the House of Suntory, renowned for its meticulous approach to spirit-making. The name "Roku" means "six" in Japanese, referring to the six traditional Japanese botanicals that define this gin's character. Each of these botanicals is harvested in its proper season to ensure peak flavor and is distilled separately using four different pot still types, each selected to best extract the essence of the particular botanical. These distillates are then blended with eight traditional gin botanicals to create a harmoniously balanced gin that represents Japanese craftsmanship and attention to detail.

                    Bombay Sapphire is distinguished by its unique vapor infusion distillation process, developed in 1761. Unlike most gins that boil botanicals directly in the spirit, Bombay Sapphire suspends its botanicals in perforated copper baskets above the spirit. As the vapor rises, it gently extracts the essential oils and flavor compounds from the botanicals, creating a more delicate and balanced flavor profile. This process takes place in the iconic Carter-Head stills at the brand's distillery in Laverstoke Mill, Hampshire. The copper stills, including the original 1831 "Still No. 1," are responsible for the gin's exceptionally smooth character.

                    Sipsmith was a pioneer in London's gin renaissance, becoming the first copper pot distillery to open in the city in nearly 200 years when it launched in 2009. The distillery employs a traditional one-shot method, where each batch is made by distilling the botanicals with the base spirit just once (rather than creating a concentrate to be diluted later). This process takes place in copper pot stills named Prudence, Patience, and Constance, with each batch being carefully monitored and hand-cut by the master distiller. The result is a gin of exceptional quality and consistency, handcrafted in small batches using traditional techniques and the finest ingredients.

                    Beefeater maintains one of the most traditional gin production methods in the industry, following the same recipe created by founder James Burrough in the 1860s. The process begins with a 24-hour steeping of the botanicals in neutral grain spirit, allowing the essential oils to fully infuse before distillation. This extended maceration is a signature element of Beefeater's production. The gin is then distilled in traditional copper pot stills, with the master distiller carefully making the "cut" to ensure only the heart of the distillation is collected. Beefeater is the only historic London Dry Gin still actually made in London, produced at the Kennington distillery with its nine stills.

                    Citadelle Gin is produced at Château de Bonbonnet in southwestern France by Maison Ferrand, a company known for its exceptional cognac. The gin is distilled using an innovative method inspired by 17th-century French gin-making traditions. The 19 botanicals are infused in the base spirit separately, each for a precise amount of time to extract optimal flavor, before being combined and distilled in small copper pot stills over an open flame. Uniquely, Citadelle employs a progressive infusion method where each botanical is added at different times during the process. In their Citadelle Reserve expression, the gin is even aged in oak barrels previously used for cognac, adding another layer of complexity.

                    Drumshanbo Gunpowder Irish Gin is crafted at The Shed Distillery in rural Ireland, the first distillery in Connacht province in over 100 years when it opened in 2014. The distillation process combines traditional copper pot still methods with modern innovation. The first six botanicals — angelica root, orris root, meadowsweet, caraway seed, star anise, and juniper berries — are added to the still with the pure Irish grain spirit. This mixture is allowed to steep for 24 hours before distillation. Then, while the spirit vapors rise through the neck of the still, they pass through a special botanical basket containing Chinese gunpowder tea, Oriental grapefruit, and Oriental lemons, allowing these more delicate ingredients to impart their flavors without being destroyed by the heat of direct distillation.

                    Gin Mare delivers a distinctly Mediterranean flavor profile unlike any other gin. The herbal notes fight for dominance in the initial taste with juniper, but ultimately the gin presents a beautiful balance of savory, herbal, and citrus elements. On the nose, experience fresh herbal notes of rosemary and basil, intertwined with the citrusy zest of Arbequina olives and the subtle sweetness of thyme. The palate is complex with rosemary, thyme, and basil readily noticeable alongside traditional gin flavors. What makes Gin Mare exceptional is its smoothness and the sophisticated way it incorporates these unique botanicals while maintaining the essential character of gin.

                    Gin Mare is produced in a 19th-century chapel converted into a distillery located in Vilanova i la Geltrú, just outside Barcelona, Spain. The production process is unique and meticulous, with each botanical distilled separately to ensure optimal flavor extraction. The Arbequina olives, rosemary, thyme, and basil—the signature Mediterranean botanicals—are all locally sourced and carefully selected for their quality and aromatic properties. After individual distillation, these botanical spirits are blended together to create the final product. The distillery uses a specially designed Florentine still and an innovative maceration process that allows the delicate herbs to impart their flavors without overwhelming the gin's balanced character. This careful process results in a spirit that truly captures the essence of the Mediterranean.

                    Plymouth Gin has a great depth of flavor with deep earthy notes and a wonderfully fresh juniper and lemony bite. The palate reveals a woody, nutty, parsnip flavor and rooty notes reminiscent of radish, carrot, beet, and soil. It's less dry than London Dry gins, with a distinctively smooth, creamy texture and a touch of sweetness. The juniper is present but more restrained, allowing citrus and spice elements to shine through. This softer profile creates a balanced, versatile gin that works exceptionally well in classic cocktails like the Martini and Gimlet.

                    Plymouth Gin is produced at the historic Black Friars Distillery, which has been in operation since 1793 and is the oldest working gin distillery in England. The production process begins with the seven botanicals being steeped in pure grain spirit and soft Dartmoor water for several hours before distillation. This mixture is then distilled in traditional copper pot stills using a single-shot method, where no additional neutral spirit is added after distillation. Plymouth Gin represents its own style of gin, distinct from London Dry, with geographic protection that requires it to be produced within the city of Plymouth. This traditional method results in a smoother, earthier gin that has been favored by the Royal Navy for over two centuries.

The Nolet family, who also created Ketel One Vodka, brings generations of expertise to their gin production. What sets Nolet's apart is their innovative approach to botanical selection and their meticulous distillation process. Each botanical is individually macerated and then distilled in ultra-modern copper pot stills, allowing for precise control over flavor extraction. The signature botanicals—Turkish rose, raspberry, and white peach—are rarely found in traditional gins and reflect the 11th generation distiller Carolus Nolet Sr.'s vision to create a gin for modern palates while respecting gin's heritage. These individually distilled botanicals are then carefully blended to create the final product.

                    Ki No Bi ("The Beauty of the Seasons") is produced at The Kyoto Distillery, Japan's first dedicated artisanal gin distillery. Their production process is both innovative and meticulous. They begin with a base spirit distilled from rice and Fushimi water, prized for its softness. The botanicals are divided into six distinct categories based on their flavor characteristics: Base, Citrus, Tea, Herbal, Spice, and Floral & Fruity. Each category is distilled separately in a copper pot still to extract the optimal flavors before being precisely blended together to create the final gin. This unique "multiple distillation" approach allows the distillers to control exactly how each botanical contributes to the final product, ensuring perfect balance and harmony—concepts deeply important in Japanese culture. The result is a gin that expresses the Japanese terroir while maintaining the essential character of traditional gin.

                    Scapegrace Gin is crafted in New Zealand using water sourced from the country's Southern Alps, known for its exceptional purity. The distillation takes place in a 19th-century John Dore copper pot still, which provides a connection to gin's traditional production methods. The 12 botanicals are steeped for 24 hours in the neutral grain spirit before distillation, allowing for thorough flavor extraction. The gin is produced in small batches with careful attention to every detail of the process. For their Black Gin variant, Scapegrace employs an innovative approach where unusual botanicals like aronia berry, saffron, pineapple, butterfly pea, and sweet potato are blended in precise amounts at specific temperatures in a defined sequence to create its unique flavor profile and naturally changing color. This combination of traditional methods and innovative approaches has earned Scapegrace international recognition and awards.

                    Junipero, launched in 1996, was a pioneer of the American craft gin movement, predating the current gin renaissance by over a decade. Produced by Hotaling & Co. (formerly Anchor Distilling), it's crafted in small batches using traditional distillation methods combined with a bold American approach. Each batch is distilled in a copper pot still, with carefully selected botanicals sourced from around the world. What sets Junipero apart is its unfiltered bottling at a robust 98.6 proof, preserving the full intensity of flavors and allowing the essential oils from the botanicals to create a slight louche (cloudiness) when the gin is chilled. This traditional approach, combined with a focus on juniper and citrus, creates a gin that respects gin's heritage while embodying the innovative spirit of American craft distilling.

                    Ford's Gin is a collaboration between 11th generation Master Distiller Charles Maxwell of Thames Distillers and Simon Ford, a gin expert with extensive industry experience. What makes Ford's unique is that it was designed specifically with bartenders in mind, focusing on how the gin would perform in cocktails. The production process begins with the nine botanicals being steeped for 15 hours in neutral grain spirit and water. This long maceration allows the flavor compounds to fully extract before distillation in traditional copper pot stills. The botanicals are sourced from trusted suppliers around the world, with particular attention to quality and consistency. The gin is distilled using a traditional one-shot method, meaning no additional neutral spirit is added after distillation, ensuring a rich, full-bodied flavor profile perfect for classic gin cocktails.

                    St. George Terroir is a gin with an intensely aromatic, distinctly Californian character. The flavor is driven by woody forest tones and gritty earthiness, with the fir and bay laurel flavors at the forefront, underscored by notes of sage and hints of citrus. On the palate, sage and bay leaves appear early, with the sage meshing with resiny juniper and fir needles, becoming slightly more minty and cool as the taste progresses. The result is a gin that captures the essence of the California wilderness—an olfactory snapshot of the Golden State's coastal mountains. This is a bold, evocative gin that transports you to a forest trail with every sip.

                    St. George Terroir Gin is produced by St. George Spirits, one of America's pioneering craft distilleries established in 1982. To capture the essence of the California landscape, they employ multiple distillation techniques for different botanicals. Douglas fir and California bay laurel are individually distilled through a process called "vapor infusion," where the botanicals are suspended in a basket above the neutral spirit during distillation, allowing the vapors to extract their essential oils. Coastal sage and other botanicals are distilled directly in the pot still. This combination of techniques allows the distillers to precisely control how each botanical contributes to the final flavor profile. The distillery uses a 1,500-liter copper pot still named "Stella" for these botanical distillations. What truly sets Terroir apart is the use of real California botanicals rather than extracts or artificial flavoring, creating an authentic expression of the California wilderness.

                <p class="mb-6">
                    Martin Miller's Gin employs a unique "dual distillation" process that separates the botanicals into two groups before distillation. The earthy botanicals (juniper, coriander, angelica, etc.) are distilled separately from the citrus elements (lemon and orange peels). This allows for optimal extraction of the essential oils from each type of botanical. These two distillates are then blended together to create a perfectly balanced spirit. What truly sets Martin Miller's apart, however, is its journey after distillation. The gin is distilled in England in a traditional copper pot still, then transported over 3,000 miles to Iceland, where it's blended with some of the purest water on Earth, drawn from Icelandic springs formed from glacial meltwater that's been filtered through lava rock for centuries. This exceptionally pure, soft water contributes to the gin's remarkable smoothness and helps integrate the botanical flavors.

                    Nikka Coffey Gin is produced by Nikka Whisky, one of Japan's most respected whisky distillers with a history dating back to 1934. The gin's name comes from the "Coffey still" used in its production—a traditional continuous still invented by Aeneas Coffey in 1830, which Nikka uses for their grain whiskies as well. This unique production method begins with a base distillate made from corn and barley in the Coffey stills. The botanicals are then divided into groups according to their characteristics and distilled separately to extract optimal flavors—a process similar to Nikka's approach to blending whisky. The Japanese botanicals, including four different Japanese citrus fruits and sansho pepper, give this gin its distinctive character. After distillation, these different botanical distillates are precisely blended to create a harmonious final product that reflects both Japanese craftsmanship and the distillery's whisky-making heritage.

                    Four Pillars Rare Dry Gin presents a distinctly Australian take on the classic gin profile. The taste begins with a strong foundation of juniper complemented by fresh whole oranges, which provide a clean citrus note throughout the gin. The native Australian botanicals, particularly lemon myrtle and Tasmanian pepperberry, add a unique layer with the pepperberry bringing warmth and spice rather than heat. The palate is perfectly balanced with a focus on the middle "sweet" palate, making it both full-flavored and smooth. The finish is clean with lingering pepper and spice notes. Overall, it offers a perfect balance between classic gin characteristics and contemporary Australian flavors.

                    Four Pillars Gin is crafted in the Yarra Valley, Australia, using a CARL copper pot still named "Wilma." The distillation process incorporates several innovative techniques that set it apart. Most notably, they use whole fresh oranges in the botanical basket of the still, rather than just the peels, adding a distinctive fresh citrus character. The distillery also employs a post-distillation basket for some botanicals to create a vapor infusion, capturing the more delicate aromas. Water for proofing the gin comes from the Yarra Valley, naturally filtered through the region's mineral-rich soils. Four Pillars also places a strong emphasis on sustainability, using spent botanicals in their "Gin Pig" program (feeding pigs that become prosciutto) and recycling other waste products. The distillers taste every batch before release to ensure consistent quality while embracing the subtle seasonal variations in their botanical ingredients.

                    Silent Pool Gin is produced at the Silent Pool Distillery located on the Duke of Northumberland's Albury Estate in the Surrey Hills. The distillation process combines traditional methods with innovative techniques. At the heart of their process is a unique four-stage method: the base botanicals are steeped in the neutral grain spirit overnight to extract their flavors; more delicate botanicals are placed in a copper basket for vapor infusion; a multi-chambered fractioning column is used during distillation for greater control over the process; and finally, a small amount of honey is added at the end to smooth and round the flavors. The distillery draws water from the Silent Pool itself, a natural spring-fed lake with crystal-clear water filtered through the chalk of the North Downs. The gin is produced in a custom-built, 350-liter Holstein still, which allows for precise temperature control during the distillation process. This meticulous approach results in a remarkably smooth and balanced gin.

                    Oxley employs a revolutionary "cold distillation" technique that sets it apart from all other gins. While traditional gin distillation uses heat to extract botanical flavors, Oxley's process occurs at -5°C (23°F) using a vacuum distillation system. This groundbreaking process took eight years and 38 prototypes to perfect. The botanicals are placed in the still with neutral grain spirit, and the pressure is reduced to create a vacuum. Under these conditions, the spirit evaporates at much lower temperatures, preserving the fresh, raw character of the botanicals without "cooking" them. Each batch is limited to only 240 bottles due to the time-consuming nature of this process. The resulting gin captures the pure essence of the botanicals in their most natural state, creating a remarkably fresh and vibrant flavor profile that cannot be achieved through traditional distillation methods.
